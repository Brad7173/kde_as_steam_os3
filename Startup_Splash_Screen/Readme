You are obviously going to want something different than kde's default splash screen running at boot.
Settings/System Settings/Appearance/Splash Screen

The best one I've found is:
https://store.kde.org/p/1427909 "Animated_loading_of_the_KDE_19"

To look better it will need to be modified.
Once you install it the files are located here:
/home/yourusername/.local/share/plasma/look-and-feel/Animated_loading_of_the_KDE_19/contents/splash/

You need to edit the Splash.qml file or use the one I've uploaded here to replace theirs.

Setting this to launch from steam via shellscript and using kwin rules for the window can make it load maximized.
It will show a giant gear and when clicked on will open an application dash panel.

Kwin rules can be imported Settings/System Settings/Window Management/Window Rules (The import button is on the bottom)

*The issue with this is that there is no task manager...if the script for the launchpad was launched from steam you can hit the stop button
but any apps opened by the application dash panel that get minimized have no way set to bring them to front

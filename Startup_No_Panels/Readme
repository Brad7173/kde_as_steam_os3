Launching Steam in Big Picture Mode to an empty desktop makes the transition smooth and quick.
This is not without quarks. You can always exit big picture mode and right click on the desktop
and add a default kubuntu panel but this is going to get tiring having to remove it before you
restart or shutdown.

We can use shellscripts from within steam such as one I am still experimenting with
calling on "plasmawindowed launchpadPlasma" however this leaves no task manager.

I've experimented around with calling both from a shellscript using the application panel and a icon only task manager but it seems to only
open the first

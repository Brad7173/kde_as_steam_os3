Launching Steam in Big Picture Mode to an empty desktop makes the transition smooth and quick.
This is not without quarks. You can always exit big picture mode and right click on the desktop
and add a default kubuntu panel but this is going to get tiring having to remove it before you
restart or shutdown.

We can use shellscripts from within steam by adding a non steam game. Then we can customize it's
icon in the properties box and customize it's banner image and custom logo in the normal window.
For grid view icons, I recomend you go here:

Latte-Dock is the answer needed!! It can be called from a shell script and launched from steam.

# kde_as_steam_os3
Running kde or Kubuntu 22.04 LTS as a Steam OS
My idea behind this is to have a dedicated OS for Steam but retain the ability to use all of Kubuntu's installed apps etc.

One of the first things I noticed when starting steam at startup in big picture mode is the transition between the desktop for kde loading and
steam going into big picture mode. It looks awful!!

This can be resolved by not using any wallpaper. Change to nothing but a black color.
This increases the speed that steam loads.
The next thing I discovered was removing any default or other panels from the dekstop as well as any widgets.
I'm using the saturn boot animation for steam's big picture mode and this works and blends in flawlessly.
It more than doubled the speed steam loads!!

gaming os and yet a full blown operating system.

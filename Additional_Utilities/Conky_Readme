Mine was designed to give me the look and feel of being online while in offline mode.
The intended purpose if I utilize what I already had will be when the "Stop" button is
pressed in steam; the latte-dock will dissappear. The conky's will dissappear. Steam
will be the only thing left on a blank desktop and it can now be taken back into big
picture mode.

Most of my old code seems intact but I need to shift some text left or right.
!! Imagine this on a 62 inch tv !!! ~ get your game face on !!

To use my conky (Steam-Conky-Panel) these are crucual unless you want to readjust the code:
Resolution: 2560 x 1440 (16:9)
Fonts: all KDE font's size 18 except small font which is 16
sudo sensors-detect - you need to run this first

Pay attention to this:

"Monitoring programs won't work until the needed modules are
loaded. You may want to run '/etc/init.d/kmod start'
to load them."
!! reboot !!
